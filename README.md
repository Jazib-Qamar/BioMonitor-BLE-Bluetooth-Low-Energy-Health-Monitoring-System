PulseNet BLE: BLE-Based Health Monitoring System
Overview
PulseNet BLE is a cutting-edge health monitoring system built on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology, designed for seamless, real-time tracking of key health parameters. This system collects data from Bluetooth-enabled health devices such as heart rate monitors, blood oxygen sensors, and blood pressure cuffs, offering an efficient, wireless solution for continuous health monitoring.

This project aims to leverage the flexibility and low power consumption of BLE to create a system that can be easily integrated into wearables or medical devices, ensuring remote and reliable monitoring of vital health metrics. The collected data is then processed and transmitted to a centralized platform (e.g., a cloud service or a local server) for analysis and visualization.
